Prevent your Lil Noun’s slow march toward doom by providing it with food and water. Think Tamagotchi, but with Lil Nouns cc0 artwork! Each Lil Noun is randomly generated based on a large set of traits when the pet is hatched. Your pet’s appearance reflects its current state. If your pet is asleep, its eyes will be closed. If your pet dies, its eyes will be crossed out, etc.

#### Current features:
* All traits from the Lil Nouns cc0 project included
* Customize your UI with a unique accent color
* Dracula theme dark mode
* Local push notifications when your pet is close to death

#### Currently in development:
* HomeScreen Widget
* Ability to save your hatched pet to the camera roll

#### Future ideas:
* Step counter to encourage fitness and wellbeing whilst also exercising your Lil Noun
* Additional game elements inspired by Tamagotchi
* Custom Lil Noun builder
* Animations
