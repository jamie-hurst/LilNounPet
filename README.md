Prevent your Lil Noun’s slow march toward doom by providing it with food and water. Think Tamagotchi, but with Lil Nouns CC0 artwork! Each Lil Noun is randomly generated based on a large set of traits when the pet is hatched. Your pet’s appearance reflects its current state. If your pet is asleep, its eyes will be closed. If your pet dies, its eyes will be crossed out, etc.

#### Current features ⌐◨-◨

* Customize your background color

* Save your pet to the camera roll
